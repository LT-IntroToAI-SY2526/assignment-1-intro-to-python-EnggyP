# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used? 
My initial experience with Python was challenging because it was my first time experiencing programming. I only knew a little bit of Java from my older sister since she would show me the amount of coding she would have to do to create a working website. So, I really can’t compare it to other programming, but to think that java seems more complicated than python because of the amount of variable usage it includes for coding. I had never written a code before, so I felt a bit intimidated by it and struggled to understand what the variables mean and how it could be included into coding. Although, it was helpful that in Python, we could get the definition of inputs to understand what they do for the program.  


2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.
I used AI effectively by asking it to help me comprehend how to define a function and acknowledging my error mistakes. For example, I asked, “Why isn't my function working the way I expected? Can you go through my program and explain to me in simple terms (5 bullet points) where I went wrong and what alternatives solutions I can use, without giving me the answer." This led to it finding mistakes like missing colons or logic issues. I also asked, “Can you explain to me like a high school tutor in how to write a function in Python that takes a word to check if it begins with a certain letter and then returns as a true or false. Can you also explain why each line of code is required to work for the program?” AI helped break down the codes, walk through each line to check where I made an error and let me know why it was wrong. Allowing me to learn how to troubleshoot.


3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them? 
Some concepts that were the most challenging were the loops and defining a function. This is because I was having difficulties working my function, since it would ask me to define a portion of the function, where I would get stuck defining it. In addition, I would usually get confused with the syntax(for example, how the range function can lead to errors).  In which, AI would explain to me in simpler terms, give me hints, and step by step examples to improve my understanding of these concepts.


4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I learned that it's better to practice first, to keep trying even if I keep failing or get stuck. It helps me better understand what I am doing wrong with my program, so I can make or think of a new different solution. I also learned to explain the code in my own words by writing in a document, in order to make it more simpler for me to comprehend while I am programming.
