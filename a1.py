INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Document your original AI prompt below
2. Copy the problems your AI assistant generated
3. Implement solutions for each problem
4. Include comments explaining your approach
5. Test your solutions with different inputs

MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
[I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have don't have any experience with Python.
I'm new to programming. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover:
> - Data
> - Conditionals (if/elif/else)
> - Loops (for and while)
> - Functions
> - Basic list operations
> 
> Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs. Without having to print the code.]

PROBLEM 1: [Age In Months]
[ Write a function called age_in_months that takes in one number (a person's age in years) and returns how many months old they are.]

Example: 
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False

PROBLEM 2: [Odd or Even?/Conditials (if/else)]
