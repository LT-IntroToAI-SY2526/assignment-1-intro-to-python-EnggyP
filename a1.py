AI-Generated Problem Set

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Document your original AI prompt below
2. Copy the problems your AI assistant generated
3. Implement solutions for each problem
4. Include comments explaining your approach
5. Test your solutions with different inputs

Remember: The goal is to LEARN, not just get working code!

MY ORIGINAL AI PROMPT:
[I'm learning Python basics in a high school programming class. I have don't have any experience with Python.
I'm new to programming. Can you create 5-7 practice problems that cover:
> - Data
> - Conditionals (if/elif/else)
> - Loops (for and while)
> - Functions
> - Basic list operations
> 
> Make them progressively more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs.]

"""
PROBLEM 1: [Greeting Generator/Variables and Data Types]
[Write a program that stores your name, age, and favorite color in variables. Then print a sentence using those variables.]

Example: 
Problem: Write a function called 'is_even' that takes an integer and returns 
True if the number is even, False if it's odd.

Example inputs/outputs:
- is_even(4) should return True
- is_even(7) should return False

    if score >= 90:
        return "A"

PROBLEM 2: [Odd or Even?/Conditials (if/else)]
[Ask the user to enter a number. Print whether the number is even or odd.]

Test all your solutions with different inputs

Add asserts if you feel comfortable

Example:
